Some run fast. Some run slow. This program predicts users' potential finish times for race distances (5k, 10k, half-marathon 21k, marathon 42k) based on their best pace per kilometer.
Given the best pace per kilometer (in minutes per kms), this program calculate predicted best finish times for: 5km, 10km, 21km, and 42km.
